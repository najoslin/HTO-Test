	<p> Millions of people use Complementary and Alternative Medicine to find natural relief from a wide range of conditions.&nbsp
	Even doctors and nurses use natural healing alternatives to relief some conditions.  &nbspThe problem is that it can be 
	very hard to find the right practitioner to help you get the relief you're looking for.  &nbspPractitioners
	frequently have the same problem - it's hard to connect with the people they are best able to help.  
	<br>
	<br>
	Heal the Onion LLC is in the process of developing the solution.  &nbspA place where its easy to find the best practitioners in your area 
	to help you get relief from condition or pain.  &nbspA place where the community can help each other identify what works and helps you 
	identify where to go to get that relief your seeking.  &nbspA place where practitioners can provide information on how they can help you 
	and can be involved in the community to better connect with the patients they can best help.</p>
